- A little hobby project of Kelley's

- Feel free to make edits!
  * copy/paste stuff (only ASCII allowed!)
  * use <Cmd> to draw boxes
  * use <Opt> for multi-selection
  * saving and undo/redo will be added soon

- The use of transitioning effects was inspired by
   Tim Holman's morphing effect (the one that
   shrinks/expands the recipes)
