  SPINACH ENCHILADAS
  ==================

  * Red enchilada sauce

    First make the red enchilada sauce, because
     it's waay to stressful to try to make both
     the sauce and the enchiladas at the same time :D

    1. Mix in a small bowl:
       - 3 TB flour
       - 1 1/2 - 2 tsp chili powder
       - 1 tsp cumin
       - 1/2 tsp tsp garlic powder
       - 1/4 tsp oregano
       - 1/4 tsp salt
       - 1/8 tsp cinnamon
    
    2. Heat 3 TB oil until shimmering,
        add spices and whisk until fragrant and the
        color has deepened, +- 1 min.
    
    3. Whisk in slowly, then simmer and whisk
        frequently for +- 5 min:

       - 2 TB tomato paste
       - 2 C veggie broth
    
    4. Remove from heat, add 1 tsp of vinegar,
        and black pepper to taste.
